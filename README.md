# Employee-Attrition
This project focuses on how an organization can reduce costs associated with employee attrition. 
Employee attrition is expensive, it can cost from 1/3 to twice an employee's salary to cover recruiters fees, pre-employment checks, training and many other costs involving rehiring. If we can determine the factors/features of why an employee might attrite, then we can help companies reduce these costs. My collaborator (Garrick Byrnes) and I, created a fictitious company called Asher Pharmaceuticals. The dataset provided consisted of 1029 historic employee records, which included some personal information about the employee, data concerning the employee's relationship with the company and the variable we are trying to predict, whether the employee resigned or not. Once we had our model, we fed the data about each current employee into the model and asked the model to generate a prediction about whether the employee is likely to resign in the near future. At this juncture, we have our predictions about the intentions of our current employees. After, using Tableau, we created an easy-to-use dashboard that can be provided to team leads, department heads, HR professionals, or anyone who is concerned about losing good employees. This dashboard focuses on the top 10 feature importances of why an employee might attrite or not.
